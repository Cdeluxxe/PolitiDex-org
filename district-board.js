   district-board.js — THE FIRST DISTRICT VOICE READER, AND IT IS A READER
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ONE SEAT HAS A BOARD YOU CAN READ AT AN ADDRESS: Utah Senate District 3 —
   North Ogden and the rest of Weber County — at /district/ut-sd-3. This module
   is the whole of that page's behaviour, and the page is three bands:

     1 · THE SEAT        who sits in it, where it is, and a link to their file.
     2 · WHO IS IN THE ROOM   four integers, every one of them from a store.
     3 · ON THE TABLE    the measures already in this archive for this seat.

   WHAT THIS PAGE IS FOR. A district had two addresses before tonight and
   neither of them was the district. /p/john_johnson is a PERSON — the sitting
   member's record, his votes, his positions, his money. /voice is a READER —
   it asks where you saved your location and puts you at whatever seat that
   names. Neither is a thing you can hand to a neighbour and say "this is ours".
   This is: a place, named, with the count of who has actually shown up in it
   and the list of what is actually on its table.

   ── THE FOUR RULES, AND THEY ARE WHY THE FILE IS THIS LONG ─────────────────

   RULE 1 · NEVER INVENT A HEADCOUNT. Every number in band 2 comes from
   /api/district-board, which counts rows in Postgres and can do nothing else.
   Not one figure on this page is computed here, inferred from anything in the
   browser, or defaulted to something plausible. A count is a claim about how
   many real people are standing in a room, and it is the single most
   forgeable-looking thing this product prints — a hardcoded "127 verified
   residents" would be indistinguishable, to a reader, from the truth. So there
   is no literal integer anywhere in this module's render path, and
   scripts/test-district-voice-sd3.mjs mounts the page against a fixture that
   returns nothing and asserts the page prints zeroes.

   RULE 2 · THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. "Nobody is here", "there is no store to
   ask", and "we could not ask" are three different facts and this page never
   collapses them:

     a real integer           → the store answered, and that is the number.
     0 + "no … on hand"       → there IS no store for this fact yet. The money
                                lane's grammar, borrowed exactly: "on hand",
                                never "yet", because "yet" promises a record
                                that may never come. See finance-lane.js.
     "could not read"         → the request failed. NOT a zero. A failed read
                                rendered as 0 verified residents is this page
                                telling a reader their district is empty
                                because a Function timed out, and that is the
                                worst lie available to it.

   RULE 3 · NO NAME, NO ADDRESS, NO EMAIL, EVER. The endpoint aggregates and
   never selects, so there is no author, body, county or date in the payload
   this file receives. That is a property of the wire, not a discipline here —
   this module could not print a neighbour's name if it were asked to, because
   it is never handed one.

   RULE 4 · NO MAJORITY, NO MOOD, NO VERDICT. Band 3 prints how many people
   answered a poll and how many wrote a comment, per measure. It never prints a
   proportion, a winning side, or "the district supports this". A poll with
   four answers is four answers; a district is not a number, and until a real
   poll store has real votes there is nothing here that could honestly be
   phrased as the district's position. No percentage appears in this file.

   ── WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────

     · NOT A STORE. No localStorage write, no sessionStorage write, no cookie,
       no IndexedDB. It does not write a location key, a district key, a team
       key or a stance key — it READS the stance count through
       PDXStanceSides.count() to tell a reader with no positions from one who
       has some, and reads nothing else off the device. The one storage write
       that happens on this page at all is PDXVotingRecord's own session copy of
       the PUBLIC record (its `?pageSize=100` baseline, the same key and the
       same query every warming caller in the app already uses), which is a
       cache of a public document and not a fact about the reader.

     · NOT A SCORE. `scored: false`, on the same terms finance-lane.js
       publishes it. No 0-100, no grade, no tier, no traffic light, no
       Direction Match. The Direction Match engine has no district-scoped read
       and this file does not invent one: alignment-tool.js is not on this
       document, and nothing here would call it if it were.

     · NOT A PARTY SURFACE. The roster row for this seat carries a party
       letter. It is deliberately not read and deliberately not printed. A
       district is a place; the person who currently sits in it has a party and
       his own file says so.

     · NOT A MONEY SURFACE. PDXFinance, WEALTH_DATA, /money's modules and both
       disclosure tables are unreachable from here — not unused, unreachable:
       no identifier in this file names any of them. The bar links to /money
       because the bar is the same row on every side-lane shell, and a
       navigation link is not a read.

     · NOT A WRITER OF ANYTHING SHARED. NEVER_FEEDS below is the machine-
       checkable form of it: this page contributes to no cross-surface global.
       Direction Match, the word-vs-action pattern index and the publication
       floor boot byte-identical with and without this module, and the suite
       asserts exactly that by twin-booting them.

     · NOT A COMPOSER. See THE POSTING SEAM.

   ── THE POSTING SEAM, AND WHY IT IS A DISABLED FIELD ───────────────────────
   Reading this board is free and open to anybody, signed in or not. POSTING to
   it is not built tonight, and the honest way to say so is a field that is
   visibly there and visibly off, with one sentence saying posting ships next.

   WHAT WAS NOT DONE, ON PURPOSE. No composer that writes to localStorage. That
   was the tempting version — a box that accepts a sentence, keeps it on the
   device, and paints it back into the board so the page feels alive. It would
   have been a forgery in two directions at once: the reader would believe they
   had posted to their district when nothing left the machine, and the sentence
   would render beside a verified-resident count as though it were a verified
   resident's. A board whose entries are unverifiable is not a lighter version
   of this product; it is the thing this product exists to be the opposite of.

   NO IDENTITY VENDOR IS WIRED. Residency verification is a real review against
   a real claim, and it is a later pass. There is therefore no personal
   residency standing on this surface at all — it is not resolved, not guessed,
   and not asked for. The page says what residency is FOR (it is how a voice is
   counted) and what it is not for (it is not how a page is read), and the
   verified count stands at whatever the store holds, which today is zero.

   ── WHERE EVERY FACT ON THE PAGE COMES FROM ────────────────────────────────
     band 1  window.CMP_DATA[PID]        the roster row. Name, office, district
                                         line. Nothing else — no bio, no score,
                                         no party, no issue chips.
     band 2  /api/district-board         four counts and a per-issue tally.
     band 3  PDXVotingRecord.fetchMember the archive read every other surface
                                         already uses, `?pageSize=100`, the
                                         baseline query. Deliberately NOT
                                         noteMember(): this is a district
                                         reader, and seeding a member's record
                                         from it would make this page an input
                                         to the record engines.
