/**
 * scripts/v103-chrome-seams.mjs
 *
 * ONE SPELLING OF THE v103 PERSON-FILE CHROME SEAMS.
 *
 * Several suites in this repo pin a booted file BYTE FOR BYTE against HEAD —
 * the federal ingest waves (F5…F9, R1, R2) do it to prove a data wave never
 * reached the engine, and scripts/test-person-crawl-block.mjs does it to prove
 * the crawl-block pass never reached the arithmetic. That discipline is the
 * reason those files can be trusted, and it is also the reason a later pass
 * that legitimately edits one of them has to come here first: a blanket hash
 * forbids the passes it is supposed to survive.
 *
 * The person-file chrome pass (CACHE_VERSION v103) edited exactly three spans
 * across two of those pinned files:
 *
 *   consistency.js, seam A — SCOPES.official.empty
 *     The official scope's `no_stance` copy said "No stated stance to check".
 *     On this scope the token means "nothing was paired", and on /p/aaron_bean
 *     the unpaired half is the WORD, not the record: the letterhead above it
 *     counted 23 mapped acts. Renamed to "No stated position to test".
 *
 *   consistency.js, seam B — scopedOverall's token ladder
 *     The ladder could only reach `no_record` — spelled "No qualifying votes on
 *     record yet" in the official scope — with an EMPTY key list, which is not
 *     an empty voting record. An empty key list means the roll-call lane has
 *     not answered yet (→ 'pending', and ask for the read) or it answered and
 *     there is no stated position to test (→ 'no_stance').
 *
 *   stance-helpers.js, one seam — _pdxStanceRecordStats
 *     It counted formal ISSUE ROWS out of an index that is empty until the
 *     roll-call cache warms, so the mid-page card called the record "still
 *     being built" while the letterhead above it counted acts. It now also
 *     reports formalActs (the acts themselves) and formalRead (whether the
 *     lane has answered at all).
 *
 * None of the three is arithmetic. No floor, band, weight, mapping, score or
 * party read or written inside any of them — which is what the assert helpers
 * below check, span by span, rather than excusing the diff.
 *
 * The anchors are unique in BOTH the HEAD and the working copy of their file.
 * If one stops being unique, widen it here — do not loosen the check.
